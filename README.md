# Telit OneEdge Example for Embedded Planet Modules

This repository contains an example of how to use the Telit OneEdge features on Embedded Planet's Agora modules.

To build for Agora, clone this repository, download all dependencies (`mbed deploy`). Then, build the program for the `EP_AGORA` mbed target.

To view the output of the example, use a terminal program to view the debug UART output. You must configure the baud rate to 115200 to ensure the output is displayed properly.
